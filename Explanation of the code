Importing the random Module:

The script starts by importing the random module, which is used later to generate random numbers for the computer's choice.
Defining Functions:

The script defines several functions, each responsible for a specific aspect of the game:
print_instructions(): Prints the rules of the game to the console.
get_user_choice(): Prompts the user to enter their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and validates the input.
get_computer_choice(): Generates a random choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) for the computer.
determine_winner(user_choice, comp_choice): Determines the winner based on the game rules, comparing the user's and computer's choices.
print_result(winner): Prints the result of the game (draw, user wins, or computer wins) to the console.
play_again(): Asks the user if they want to play again and returns True or False based on their input.
Main Function (main()):

The main() function serves as the entry point of the script.
It calls print_instructions() to display the rules of the game.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues until the user decides not to play again.
Inside the loop, it:
Calls get_user_choice() to prompt the user for their choice.
Calls get_computer_choice() to randomly generate the computer's choice.
Prints the choices made by both the user and the computer.
Calls determine_winner() to find out who won the game.
Prints the result using print_result().
Asks the user if they want to play again using play_again(). If the user chooses not to play again, the loop breaks.
Running the Script:

At the end of the script, main() is called if the script is executed directly (__name__ == "__main__").
This starts the execution of the game, allowing the user to play against the computer.
Game Flow:

The game flow involves the user making a choice, the computer generating a random choice, and then determining the winner based on the game rules.
The process continues until the user decides not to play again.
